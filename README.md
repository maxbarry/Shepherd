**This is an obsolete version.** It is basically a snapshot of the codebase as it was in 2011.

Original Shepherd is no longer actively maintained. To get it up and running in 2018, you have two options:

1. Use the Perkins fork: https://shepherd.tv/

2. Use the Xander Victory fork: https://github.com/ShephedProject/shepherd
